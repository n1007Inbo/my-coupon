      "When shopping for baby apparel, choosing organic fabrics is only half the battle. To ensure the materials remain soft, chemical-free, and safe for your baby's delicate skin, you need to follow correct washing guidelines. Conventional laundry detergents often contain harsh enzymes, synthetic fragrances, and brighteners that can trigger eczema or contact dermatitis in newborns.",
      "To preserve the organic integrity of these premium clothes, we recommend using a plant-based, hypoallergenic laundry detergent. Always wash new baby clothes before their first use to remove any dust or fibers. Using cold water cycles and mild, eco-friendly spin speeds helps prevent shrinkage and extends the life of organic cotton fibers.",
      "Avoid chemical fabric softeners and dryer sheets entirely, as they leave a synthetic residue on the fabric. Instead, opt for wool dryer balls or line-drying. Our testing shows that proper maintenance keeps organic baby wear feeling soft and fresh for multiple children."
